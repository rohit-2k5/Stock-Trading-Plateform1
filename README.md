# TradeVista

TradeVista is full-stack project using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).
This project is heavily inspired by Zerodha, Indiaâ€™s largest stock trading platform. Building this project helped me learn how to design a clean UI, work with APIs, manage state across components,
and structure a full-stack application.

The application simulates a basic trading platform where users can explore features similar to real-world trading apps. It includes a frontend for users, a separate admin dashboard, and a secure backend API.

# What I Learned

--> Structuring a complete MERN project with multiple modules

--> Building reusable UI components with React

--> Using Context API and Axios for data flow and API calls

--> Managing environment variables and backend security

--> Handling multiple servers (frontend, backend, and admin dashboard)

# Features

Frontend: User-facing interface with smooth navigation,
Dashboard: Admin control panel to manage data,
Backend: RESTful API built with Express.js and MongoDB
Modular design and environment-variable based configuration

# Tech Stack

--> Frontend: React, Context API, Axios

--> Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB

--> Dashboard: React (with Context API)

# Inspiration

This project is inspired by Zerodha. Rebuilding a simplified version of their platform gave me a strong foundation in MERN stack development and helped me understand how professional trading apps work.
